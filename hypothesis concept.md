Concepts of Hypothesis Testing - I


Hypothesis — a claim or an assumption that you make about one or more population parameters
Types of hypothesis:  

Null hypothesis (H₀) - Makes an assumption about the status quo       
                                     - Always contains the symbols ‘=’, ‘≤’ or ‘≥’

Alternate hypothesis (H₁) - Challenges and complements the null hypothesis  

                                                                  - Always contains the symbols ‘≠’, ‘<’ or ‘>’

Types of tests:  
Two-tailed test - The critical region lies on both sides of the distribution  
                             - The alternate hypothesis contains the ≠ sign
Lower-tailed test - The critical region lies on the left side of the distribution  
                                - The alternate hypothesis contains the < sign
Upper-tailed test - The critical region lies on the right side of the distribution  
                                                 - The alternate hypothesis contains the > sign

Making a decision - Critical value method:  

Calculate the value of Zc from the given value of α (significance level)  

Calculate the critical values (UCV and LCV) from the value of Zc  

Make the decision on the basis of the value of the sample mean   
¯
x  
 with respect to the critical values (UCV AND LCV)
